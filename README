The main points of the program are:
  - checker logic implementation
  - alpha-beta pruning algorithm for computer
    decision making

Important!
“help” and “credits” buttons are just placeholders.
“new game” button is not fully tested.

Usage:
If you click on a board, a field should select with
a number on it. In order to move a piece from ex. 7b
to 6a you have to select them in right order and
press “apply move”.
In order to clear selection “cancel move” can be used.

Implemented rules:
  - force capture;
  - a piece must end in a position where it cannot
    capture any further opponent pieces;
  - after a piece reaches the farthest row it becomes
    a king.
    Transformation does not happend if the end row is
    not the last place in a move;
  - king can move freely on a single diagonal in one
    move.
